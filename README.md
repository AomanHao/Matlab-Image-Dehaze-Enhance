### Abstract
Images captured in foggy weather conditions often
suffer from bad visibility. In this paper, we propose an efficient
regularization method to remove hazes from a single input
image. Our method benefits much from an exploration on the
inherent boundary constraint on the transmission function.
This constraint, combined with a weighted L1âˆ’norm based
contextual regularization, is modeled into an optimization
problem to estimate the unknown scene transmission. A quite
efficient algorithm based on variable splitting is also presented
to solve the problem. The proposed method requires only
a few general assumptions and can restore a high-quality
haze-free image with faithful colors and fine image details.
Experimental results on a variety of haze images demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
